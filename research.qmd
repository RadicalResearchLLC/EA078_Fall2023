## Group Project Topics of Interest

I photographed the following topic areas on the chalkboard.

![PhotographTopics](images/GroupProjects.jpg) Topics include:

-   Agricultural Land

-   Community Gardens

-   Habitat and Biodiversity

-   Potential Future Habitat

-   Fish Passages

-   Bikeways

-   Public accessible recreational lands

### Load libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
```

## Data directory

The seven `.geojson` files should be in your working directory, moved from dropbox as homework. If you haven't got them there, please do that now.

Check your working directory.

```{r}
#| label: check wd
#| echo: true

getwd()

```

Then check the files directory to make sure the `.geosjon` files are in the working directory.

## Example 1 - Community Gardens

The first step is always to import the dataset. Let's start with the community gardens layer from the Greenprint dataset. `.geojson` files are a geospatial data file format. We can use `st_read()` to import the data.

```{r}
#| label: import community gardens
#| echo: TRUE

gardens <- st_read(dsn = 'CommunityGardens.geojson')

```

The gardens dataset is 186 observations of 13 variables and is a Geometry type `POINT`. Let's make a leaflet map with mouseover labels. @fig-Gardens shows a map of California using \`leaflet'. We will start with simple markers. @fig-Gardens shows the result.

```{r}
#| label: fig-Gardens
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Community gardens in Southern California

leaflet() |> 
  addTiles() |> 
  addMarkers(data = gardens)
```

### In-class exercise \# 1

-   Improve the basic gardens map by including a `label` of the Name of the garden on mouseover.
-   Improve the basic gardens map by choosing to add a feature of your choice.

### In-class exercise \# 2

-   Import the FishPassages.geojson dataset
-   Make a basic markers map of Fish Passages.
-   Discuss with your neighbors what a Fish passage is and how it might be visualized effectively. What other should be added to this visualization?

## Example 2 - Potential future habitats

Import the dataset `FutureHabitats.geojson`.

```{r}
#| label: import future habitats
#| echo: TRUE

habitats <- st_read(dsn = 'FutureHabitats.geojson')

```

There are 3228 features and four fields. The geometry type is `MULTIPOLYGON`.

Let's make a leaflet map to see what this is.

@fig-Habitats shows the potential habitats. .

```{r}
#| label: fig-Habitats
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: Potential future habitats listed by California Coastal Conservancy

leaflet() |> 
  addTiles() |> 
  addPolygons(data = habitats)

```

### In-class exercise 3

-   Modify the visualization to change the Tile layer to something more appropriate. Use the `AddProviderTiles()` function.
-   The data from this layer is described at [TheNatureConservancy](https://www.scienceforconservation.org/products/coastal-assessment). What does this data layer show? What might be a good addition to this visualization to highlight this data layer?

## Example 3 - Biodiversity layer

Import the data.

```{r}
#| label: import biodiversity data
#| echo: TRUE

biodiversity <- st_read(dsn = 'Biodiversity.geojson') |> 
  st_transform(crs = 4326) |> 
  st_zm()

```

This dataset has 6 fields, 2015 features, and is a `MULTIPOLYGON` geometry type. One of the fields is described as `RANK` and has a ranking. Let's make a leaflet visualization using a Rank color palette.

First, make the color palette. This is a factor, rather than a numeric or quantile, so we use the `colorFactor()` function. I chose the `Spectral` palette but you can choose any palette you think will work.

```{r}
#| label: Color palette for biodiversity
#| echo: true

palBD <- colorFactor(domain = biodiversity$RANK, palette = 'Spectral')

```

The @fig-BiodiversityMap shows the areas of high and low biodiversity in SoCal. I incorporated a legend, color palette, and used the Positron Tile layer instead of OSM.

```{r}
#| label: Not working figure on the render
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| fig-cap: Figure caption

leaflet() |> 
  addProviderTiles(provider = providers$CartoDB.Positron) |> 
  setView(lat = 34.0, lng = -117.8, zoom = 10) |> 
  addPolygons(data = biodiversity,
              color = ~palBD(RANK),
              weight = 1) |> 
  addLegend(data = biodiversity,
            title = 'Biodiversity',
            values = ~RANK,
            pal = palBD)

```

This is an interesting map, but has a definite resolution issue as the hex-grids are pretty obvious when one zooms in to a municipal level.

### In-class exercise #4

-   Import the `AgLand.geojson` dataset.
-   Make a leaflet map showing the TYPE of agricultural land.
-   Choose a provider tile that adds information to the map.

### In-class exercise #5

-   Import one of the other datasets.
-   Identify the GEOMETRY TYPE
-   Make a leaflet map with the appropriate type of data display
